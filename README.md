# CIFAR-10 Image Classification

<p align="justify">This code segment focuses on building an image classification model for the CIFAR-10 dataset. CIFAR-10 is a popular dataset containing 60,000 32x32 color images across 10 different classes. The code covers various essential steps for handling the dataset and training the model.

### Data Acquisition
<p align="justify">The code begins by downloading the CIFAR-10 dataset using the Kaggle API. It configures the API, retrieves the dataset, and extracts it for further processing.

### Label Processing
<p align="justify">Labels are loaded from the provided 'trainLabels.csv' file and mapped to their corresponding numerical classes. This mapping is crucial for training the image classification model.

### Image Processing
<p align="justify">Images are loaded, converted into numpy arrays, and assembled into training and testing datasets. Images are normalized to a scale of 0 to 1 by dividing by 255.

### Train-Test Split
<p align="justify">The training dataset is split into training and validation subsets using a test size of 20%. This helps assess the model's performance.

### Building the Neural Network
<p align="justify">A neural network is created using TensorFlow and Keras, comprising input layers, dense layers, and an output layer with 10 neurons (one for each class). The model is compiled with the Adam optimizer and sparse categorical cross-entropy loss.

### ResNet50
<p align="justify">In addition to the custom neural network, a ResNet50 architecture is implemented for comparison. The pre-trained ResNet50 model is loaded and fine-tuned for the CIFAR-10 dataset.

### Training and Evaluation
<p align="justify">Both the custom neural network and the ResNet50 model are trained and evaluated on the CIFAR-10 dataset. Performance metrics are tracked during training.

# Intel Image Classification

### Project Overview

<p align="justify">In this project, we'll work with Intel Images, which are images of various categories such as buildings, forests, streets, and more. The goal is to create a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and train it on these images for multi-class classification using the Keras library.

### Getting Started

<p align="justify">To get started with this project, you need to mount your Google Drive in Colab. Make sure you've uploaded the dataset to your Google Drive. Once your Drive is mounted, you can access the dataset directly from your Drive within the Colab environment.

### Important Imports

<p align="justify">This project requires several essential libraries, including NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, OpenCV, and Keras. These libraries help with data processing, visualization, image handling, and creating the neural network model.

### Dataset Exploration

<p align="justify">The dataset contains images categorized into different classes, such as mountains, forests, streets, etc. You can explore the classes and visualize images within them. Understanding your dataset is a crucial step in any machine learning project.

### Data Preprocessing

<p align="justify">Data preprocessing involves reading and resizing images to make them uniform in size for the model. We also perform one-hot encoding for the labels using LabelBinarizer. Additionally, we split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets.

### Model Architecture

<p align="justify">The CNN model is designed with several layers, including convolutional layers, activation functions, max-pooling layers, and dense layers. The final output layer uses the softmax activation function for multi-class classification.

### Model Training

<p align="justify">We train the model using the training data, specifying the number of epochs and batch size. You can experiment with these hyperparameters to optimize model performance.

### Model Evaluation

<p align="justify">After training, we evaluate the model on the test data to calculate accuracy. The model's predictions can be compared with the original labels to assess its performance.
